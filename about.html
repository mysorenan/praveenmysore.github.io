      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">About Me</h2>

      <p class="mb-4">
        I am a <strong>Silicon Design Engineer</strong> currently working at <strong>Ampere Computing</strong>, where I focus on micro-architecture, RTL design, and SoC timing/power closure for next-generation data-center and AI processors. 
        My work bridges hardware design and performance optimization, helping to deliver efficient and scalable compute for emerging workloads.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        Between 2016 and 2023, I gained deep experience across the silicon design stack — from physical design and verification to architecture exploration and performance modeling. 
        Earlier in my career, I worked on system-level hardware/software integration and modeling, which shaped my interest in holistic processor design.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        I hold a <strong>Master’s degree in Computer Engineering</strong> from the <strong>University of Southern California (USC)</strong>, where my academic focus spanned computer architecture, digital systems design, and embedded hardware acceleration.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-8">
        Beyond my professional work, I’m an endurance cyclist and lifelong learner. 
        I enjoy exploring the intersection of engineering discipline and creative endurance — whether designing complex logic or chasing long miles on the road.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">About This Website</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">
        This website is my <strong>personal archive and playground</strong> — a space to collect notes, publish technical writings, and share reflections that connect logic, life, and learning. 
        Some articles focus on design methodologies and hardware architecture, while others are meditations on curiosity, craftsmanship, and clarity of thought.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        These writings are primarily a record for myself, but they’re open to anyone who might find them useful. 
        If something here resonates, I’d be glad to hear from you.
      </p>
